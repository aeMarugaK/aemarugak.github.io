                            <strong>Special Session Aims and Scope</strong>
                        </h1>
                        <div style="text-align: justify">The fusion of scalable computing infrastructure, big data, and
                            artificial intelligence has boosted the development and application of data science and
                            advanced data analytics. However, the recently emerging threats on the privacy, security,
                            and trust (PST) of the data and the analytics models have shown a dramatically increasing
                            trend with the wide deployment of data analytics applications. Specifically, the PST attacks
                            on data or models such as model inversion attacks, membership inference attacks, data
                            poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and model backdoors, have severely made advanced data
                            analytics highly vulnerable, particularly in common scenarios where data are distributed or
                            computation is outsourced like MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service). On the other hand,
                            defence solutions are proposed as new computing schemes, PST frameworks, algorithms, and
                            methods. For example, differential privacy, federated learning, and machine unlearning are
                            proposed for privacy protection in data analytics, and adversarial machine learning is
                            proposed to achieve robust, secure, and trustworthy data analytics. Given the importance and
                            urgency, this special issue aims to provide a venue for researchers, practitioners and
                            developers from different background areas relevant to PST and data analytics to exchange
                            their latest experience, research ideas, and synergic research and development on
                            fundamental issues and applications about privacy, security, and trust issues in data
                            analytics, as a strong supplement to the main track of data science and advanced analytics.

                            and start at page 11). This supplement can only be used to include:
